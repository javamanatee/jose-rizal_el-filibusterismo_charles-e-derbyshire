					<span>O masters, lords, and rulers in all lands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is this the handiwork you give to God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This monstrous thing distorted and soul-quenched?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How will you ever straighten up this shape-;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Touch it again with immortality;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Give back the upward looking and the light;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rebuild in it the music and the dream;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make right the immemorial infamies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perfidious wrongs, immedicable woes?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O masters, lords, and rulers in all lands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How will the future reckon with this man?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How answer his brute question in that hour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When whirlwinds of rebellion shake the world?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How will it be with kingdoms and with kings⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With those who shaped him to the thing he is⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When this dumb terror shall reply to God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the silence of the centuries?</span>
